**How my mind ticks**
Selfmade self-tought guy that has love for setting up businesses, passion for gambling industry related projects and unrelentless drive to learn and grow as a person.

Will very much take up iniative and look at product as a whole instead of narrowing down to just the job request. Able to quickly scope project by looking at similar existing products, taking it's good features and combine them to the new product.

Able to setup full business ideas quickly and interactive. Being very frank about what I think and I enjoy to brainstorm with clients and discuss options and go for fastest track to test out the options.

*Self tought software developer loving Laravel Framework, NodeJS, Go, Nextjs framework, Nuxt framework, Dockerizing, Kubernetes - picking up new frameworks pretty fast.*

Would not class myself as a developer but as a business sprinter, that can quickly develop & put products in market. After a positive market response to then further work on product.
